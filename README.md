# SmartCompiler

SmartCompiler is a professional C++ compiler frontend built with React and Vite. It demonstrates the complete compilation process from source code to target assembly code, providing detailed insights into each compilation phase. This project serves as an educational tool and a demonstration of compiler frontend concepts implemented in a modern web application.

## Features

- Upload and edit C++ source files (.cpp, .cxx, .cc)
- Lexical Analysis (Tokenization)
- Syntax Analysis (Abstract Syntax Tree generation)
- Semantic Analysis with warnings for unused variables and functions
- Intermediate Code Generation
- Target Assembly Code Generation
- Error handling with detailed error and warning messages
- Interactive UI with tabs for source code and compilation results
- Accordion views for detailed compilation outputs
